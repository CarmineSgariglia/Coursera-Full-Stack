In this part of the course, I completed several practical exercises using Bootstrap to better understand and apply its core components and utility classes.

I practiced:

- Using the grid system to build responsive layouts  
- Working with containers, rows, and columns  
- Customizing elements through utility classes (spacing, colors, display, etc.)  
- Implementing components such as navbars, cards, buttons, and forms  
- Applying the essential principles of responsive design  

These hands-on tests helped me become more familiar with Bootstrap’s modular structure and with creating modern, responsive interfaces efficiently across different devices.
