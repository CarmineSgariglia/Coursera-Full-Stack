# Responsive Design & Bootstrap Components

## Responsive Design
Responsive design is based on the combination of:
- **Flexible grids**
- **Fluid images**
- **Media queries**

## Breakpoints
Breakpoints are the points at which a website’s layout and content adapt to provide the best user experience on each device.

Types of grids:
- **Fixed grid:** fixed columns, flexible margins  
- **Fluid grid:** flexible content from edge to edge, columns can resize  
- **Hybrid grid:** combination of the two
