# Module 3 – Summary  

In Module 3 I learned the basics of **Bootstrap**, an introduction to **React**, and how the **DOM** works.  
We also covered **dependencies**, **JavaScript bundlers**, and **lazy loading**.

---

## Dependencies  
Dependencies are external packages (libraries, frameworks, modules) required by a project to work.  
Examples: React, Tailwind, Bootstrap.

---

## JavaScript Bundlers  
Tools like **Vite**, **Webpack**, and **Parcel** that bundle, optimize, and prepare all project files for the browser.  
They produce the final assets (JS, CSS, images) and help build efficient applications.

---

## Lazy Loading  
A performance technique that loads parts of an application **only when needed**, reducing initial load time and improving performance.

---

## Bootstrap Notes  
Official docs: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/

- **Infix:** responsive breakpoint indicators (e.g., `col-sm-6`, `text-md-center`, `d-lg-none`)
- **Modifier:** style variations (e.g., `btn-primary`, `btn-lg`, `alert-danger`, `card-body`)

## CSS Framework Overview

### **Bootstrap**
- Popular UI framework with components and responsive grid.  
- Best for: quick and responsive layouts.

### **Foundation**
- Flexible, customizable, and similar to Bootstrap.  
- Best for: large and complex projects.

### **Pure.css**
- Very lightweight CSS library.  
- Best for: performance-focused projects.

### **Tailwind CSS**
- Utility-first framework for highly customizable designs.  
- Best for: projects needing full styling flexibility.

### **UIKit**
- Lightweight with modular components.  
- Best for: clean and simple interfaces.

### **MVP.css**
- Styles HTML automatically without extra classes.  
- Best for: fast prototyping.

## React and Common JavaScript Libraries  
React is a **library**, not a framework.

### Useful Libraries with React
- **Lodash:** Utility functions (sorting, formatting, calculations).  
- **Luxon:** Date/time management and formatting.  
- **Redux:** Global state management (e.g., cart, user data).  
- **Axios:** HTTP requests with advanced features.  
- **Jest:** Automated testing with coverage reports.
