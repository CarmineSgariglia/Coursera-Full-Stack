# Introduction to JavaScript  

In this part of the course, we began exploring the fundamentals of **JavaScript**, running tests both in **Visual Studio Code** and in the **DevTools console** inside Google Chrome.

We introduced and practiced:

- Using `console.log` and the DevTools console
- The basics of conditional logic
- Switch statements
- Working with variables
- The main loops (iteration structures)
- The fundamental syntax rules of the language

These topics form the essential foundation for understanding how JavaScript works and for beginning to develop small programs and scripts.
